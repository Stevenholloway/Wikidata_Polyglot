# Wikidata_Polyglot
a browser extension for passing embedded URLs to Wikidata. 
Based on the excellent Wikidata browser extension created by Toby Hudson (https://github.com/99of9/Entity-Explosion), this work-in-progress is intended to port the original extension's ability to query Wikidata resources to URLs embedded in web pages, not just browser tabs.
